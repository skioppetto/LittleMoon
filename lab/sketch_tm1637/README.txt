Avishay Orpaz has written an excellent library for TM1637 displays, the TM1637Display library. This library has several built-in functions that make controlling the display fairly easy.

The main functions include:

setSegments() – Set the raw value of the segments of each digit
showNumberDec() – Display a decimal number
showNumberDecEx() – Display a decimal number with decimal points or colon
setBrightness() – Set the brightness of the display
clear() – Clear the display
